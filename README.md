# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python, based on collaborative filtering techniques. It guides the users through the process of building a recommendation system from scratch.

## Summary

- **Concept Overview**: Introduction to recommendation systems and the importance of collaborative filtering in generating personalized recommendations for users.

- **Implementation Walkthrough**: Step-by-step guide on implementing the recommendation system using Python. The process includes data loading, data preprocessing, creating a ratings matrix, computing similarities between users, and generating movie recommendations based on similar users' ratings.

- **Code Examples**: The Jupyter Notebook provides code examples and explanations to help understand each step of the implementation process.

- **Enhancements**: Discussion on potential enhancements for the recommendation system, such as implementing item-based collaborative filtering, exploring advanced algorithms like matrix factorization, and developing a web interface for user interaction.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure you have movie data and user ratings data available.
2. **Implementation**: Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to implement the recommendation system using Python.
3. **Enhancements**: Consider implementing additional features or enhancements to improve the recommendation system's accuracy and user experience.
